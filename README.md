Hotel booking analysis is an EDA project. In this, By using Python I cleaned the data manipulated the data and by doing analysis i.e Univariatae analysis, Bivariate analysis, Multivariate analysis found some insights and business solutions.

Business Objective: 
If the company is doing well, we should focus on improving it even more. However, it is critical to be aware of any unfavourable variables that may have an impact on the business and prioritise fixing them in order to turn the negative aspects into positive ones.
1) How to Increase Customer Bookings?
Solution: Because many clients book hotels through travel agencies, it is critical to focus on strengthening connections with these agents in order to attract new business. Providing customers with the greatest bargains and incentives may aid in increasing bookings.
2) How may the cancellation rate be reduced?
Solution: In order to maintain a positive business, it is essential to focus on lowering the amount of cancellations. One approach could be to develop policies that provide clients with refunds based on their cancellation and booking duration.
3) Is it an appropriate way to raise hotel booking prices?
Solution: Yes, in some situations, increasing hotel costs during peak seasons when demand is high might be helpful. Raising hotel rates in major cities, for example, during the popular month of August, could help produce more money.
4) Global Distribution System for hotel reservations in resorts?
Solution: Global Distribution Network There are no bookings for the resort hotel; focusing on these resort hotels through GDS would be beneficial for the good impact.
5) How can long-stay city hotel consumers be converted to resort hotel customers?
Solution: While many long-term guests prefer city hotels, resort hotels can produce greater revenue. To entice these clients to book resort hotels, agents might be offered greater prices and incentives to persuade them to switch.

Conclusion:
1) Because the majority of consumers favour A-rooms, hotels should expand their number to generate more money.
2)Transient consumers cancel more frequently, but when people book in groups, there are less cancellations; so, hotels should provide some deals to reduce cancellations.
3) Since May to August sees the highest number of reservations, hotels should entice guests with appealing deals to boost their off-season bookings.
4) Because fewer hotel guests are returning, management should use guest feedback to enhance the hotel's amenities and boost the number of returning visitors.
5)The countries that send us the most visitors—Portugal, France, and the UK—are also the ones that bring in the most money.Portugal is the country that generates the most bookings and income. To increase sales, marketing teams should focus on these nations.
6)The most frequent type of visitor is a couple, and fulfilling their demands can boost revenue. More specific demands are typically made by larger groups of people.
7) Longer stays (more than 15 days) typically yield better offers due to lower adr. Booking cancellations are not severely impacted by not getting the same reserved room, longer lead times, or waiting periods, but a different room allotment can reduce the adr.
8) When booking hotels, a large group nearly 94% does not need parking spaces.
9)Most guests stay for less than 5 days in a hotel, while the Resort hotel is preferred for longer stays.
